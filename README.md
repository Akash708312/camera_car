The main aim of this project is to develop a webcam based Real-Time Face Detection System. This application not only detects faces but it can also predict the age and gender of those faces detected. Moreover, it uses database lookup to match identified faces.

Features

Real-time face detection: It records video from the web cam and traces faces in every frame.
Age estimation: An algorithm used to guess ages of people found within a frame.
Gender Prediction: It is programmed to detect gender of peopleâ€™s images obtained by camera.
Face recognition: Facial data is compared with the databank in order to find out who it belongs to.
